# Kidney-Stone-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
This project applies deep learning for detecting kidney stones from CT scans using CNNs. It compares a custom CNN with a transfer learning model to evaluate performance. The custom CNN achieved 92% accuracy, outperforming transfer learning, showing model design can surpass pretrained approaches.
